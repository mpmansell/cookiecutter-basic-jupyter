## Prerequisites

The following tools will need to be installed

### Required

- git - [Git Git https://git-scm.com](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://git-scm.com/&ved=2ahUKEwjpuNPwlNKRAxVaQ_EDHRPtOxUQFnoECA8QAQ&usg=AOvVaw1lFNWgbWf8FsbaoU4AOPBr)

**Note**: Use `make vsc`, or `poetry run code -n .` to start Visual Studio Code as this will ensure that Intellicode, or the AI language server, will be aware of the imported modules (If, for instance, `numpy` objects are not appropriately highlighted, or typed, you might have started Vsc outside of the poetry manage virtual environment.)

### Optional

These are optional and depend on whether, or not, you need [Docker](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)&ved=2ahUKEwia-fTvldKRAxWGRPEDHe1NGxEQFnoECA0QAQ&usg=AOvVaw0z0Prdwu6k0Lwh1-puSNOO) or to generate some extended documentation (NOTE: Makefile incomplete for documentation)

## Get Started

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}` for local development.

1. Fork the `{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.git
   ```

3. Create the Poetry managed virtual environment

   ```sh
   cd {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/
   poetry install
   ```

4. Create a branch for local development:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass linting and the tests

   ```sh
   make lint
   make test
   # Or
   make test-all
   ```

   The linting and test tools are declared in the `pyproject.toml` file and any changes in requirements should be reflected here.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
   git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.md.
3. The pull request should work for Python {{cookiecutter.python_version}}. Tests run in GitHub Actions on every pull request to the main branch, make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

## Tips

To run a subset of tests:

```sh
pytest tests.test_{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
```

## Deploying

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy. Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.md). Then run:

```sh
bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
git push
git push --tags
```

You can set up a [GitHub Actions workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/building-and-testing/building-and-testing-python#publishing-to-pypi) to automatically deploy your package to PyPI when you push a new tag.
