# TODO



These are some of the things that need to be completed with this template:

- Add testing

- Add Linting and type checking

- Improve the CI integration

- Modify the top level `Makefile` to provide only the commands relevent to generation of a project from the template, and managing the development and maintenence of the Template, as well as handling releases
  
- Create release/build CI/make target to create a Zipfile that can be downloaded and used

- TODO looking at [Generate Changelog](https://callowayproject.github.io/generate-changelog/)
    - have tested by adding to template invokation level. Not entirely sure if this does what I would like
