## Not Exactly What You Want?

Don't worry, you have options:

### Fork This / Create Your Own

If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork this
to create your own version. Or create your own; it doesn't strictly have to
be a fork.

### Or Submit a Pull Request

I also accept pull requests on this, if they're small, atomic, and if they
make my own packaging experience better.
